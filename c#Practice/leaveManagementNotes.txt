Create Interfaces

ILeaveTypeRepository : IRepositoryBase<LeaveType>

LeaveType : ILeaveTypeRepository

Implement the base interface 
Repository Base uses a template <T> for generic type
IRepositoryBase only has the CRUD functions


In order to hook classes to the database, need to create an ApplicationDbContext object

private readonly ApplicationDbContext _db;

Make the constructor take an ApplicationDbContext object as input and set it to _db

In startup.cs, need to add references for the Repositories and Contracts:

services.AddScoped<ILeaveTypeRepository, LeaveTypeRepository>();

ViewModel may have fewer components than the class itself since it's for the view. 

Viewmodels should not reference data classes, just other view models
